# Crack-Detection-CNN


Data from: [https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/all_datasets/48/]

**Data Preprocessing:** Load images, resize, normalize, and split into training/validation sets.        
**Model Building:** Define a CNN with layers suited for feature extraction and classification.         
**Training:** Fit the model to your training data, adjusting parameters as needed.        
**Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance on unseen data.          
**Inference:** Apply the model to new images for crack detection.
